African COVID-19 response was successful because of harsh lockdowns. Social distancing also took place in Africa. Social media was used for coronavirus prevention information. Student volunteers
helped with forcing people to follow the guidelines for coronavirus. Food was provided to people who were vulnerable. Technology like robots were used for temperature readings in the public. Drones
were used for communicating to many people in Rwanda.
