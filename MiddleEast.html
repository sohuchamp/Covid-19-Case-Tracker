    The Middle east as a whole was inflicted by Covid in the summer of 2020. Countries such as Turkey are hitting there peak right now, with the countries' leaders mulling a lockdown.
    Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE each went in and out of lockdowns, sometimes opening far too quickly. However, now all three have launched successful vaccination campaigns. Both Israel and the UAE are the goal standard in terms of vaccinating their population, with life nearly returning to normal in both
    countries.
