    <h2 class = "response" >British Covid Response:</h2>
<p class = "response" style="font-size: 25px"> The British covid response featured many instances where the spread of the virus was curbed and then a quick resurgence. This is partly because they
    were quick to re-open, leading resurgences of the virus. This was only compounded by the new strain discovered in Great Britain, which is more infectious than the original strain. Luckily, the
    vaccine role-out has been efficient and quick in the United Kingdom.
