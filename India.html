    <h2 class = "response" >South Asian Covid Response:</h2>
<p class = "response" style="font-size: 25px"> The Indian and Pakistani Covid responses have included strict lockdowns and mutliple resurgences of the virus. The Indian government enacted some of the
    strictest lockdowns in the world, where people could be arrested for simple leisure activities. With early success, India re-opened their economy. However, the virus has resurged multiple times
    and the country is been in and out of lockdown phases since. The government is now attempting to vaccinate the population; however, the process has been extremely slow and drawn out. As of
    April 2021, new variants have been discovered in India and the number of cases has surged there. Maharashtra is in a lockdown state currently due to the surge in variants. Pakistan has also experienced a resurgence,
    with the army being called to cities in order to enforce new public health measures. If you are in South Asia, stay safe and stay home.
