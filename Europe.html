Countries such as Norway, Switzerland, and Ukraine are not member-states of the European Union. Each of those three nations imposed lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus. A resurgence has also
    hit each of those nations, with Norway and Ukraine still being in lockdown-like scenarios. This is partly due to the slow vaccination programs in the countries. Norway halted their use of the
    AstraZeneca shot after four people died due to side-effects. Switzerland continues to see a rise in cases ; however, they are still pushing through woth their re-opening plan in order to
    kickstart their battered economy. All in all, Covid-19 is still very much a big issue in these European nationas.
