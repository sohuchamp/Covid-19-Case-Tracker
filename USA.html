    <h2 class = "response" >American Covid Response</h2>
<p class = "response" style="font-size: 25px"> The American coronavirus has been heavily criticized because of its failure to curb the spread of the virus. This can be attributed to the largely
    decentralized healthcare system, causing a chaotic response where hospitals were quickly flooded with serious cases. With more and more of the country now being vaccinated, cases have been
    consistently going down and the economy is facing a quicker than expected recovery.
