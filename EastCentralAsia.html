<p class = "response" style="font-size: 25px"> There is still a widespread mystery surrounding the Covid-19 situation in both Russia and the epicenter of the disease China. China is now all but
    done with the pandemic, with the country boasting near single digit daily case counts for consecutive months. It has been a year since Wuhan exited the brutal 76 day lockdown, and now China as
    whole looks to vaccinate the public and truly place Covid in the rear view mirror. In terms of Russia,  there have been reports of cases being under-reported by the government. The data
    provided is often deemed inaccurate by third party experts. Lastly, South Korea and Japan did an excellent job in controlling the pandemic through massive contact tracing efforts and the public
    embracing mask-wearing. However, a slow inoculation program leaves South Kore and Japan in vulnerable positions.
