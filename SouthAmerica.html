Latin America as a whole was hit extremely hard from Covid-19. This stemmed from government failures and lack of existing infrastructure. In the example of Brazil, the leadership in place is
    extremely anti-science and downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic. Therefore, Brazil became the second worst hit country in the world. Both Argentina and Colombia are experiencing an even
    more deadly third wave, and the health infrastructure is heavily strained in both countries. While not facing as many cases, Mexico boasts the highest death rate in the world. Many hospitals
    are overwhelmed. The problems in Latin America are only compounded by a slow vaccine rollout.
