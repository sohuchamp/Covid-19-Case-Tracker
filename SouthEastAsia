    Ranging from Cambodia to Singapore, southeast Asia has done an excellent job in controlling the spread of the disease. Countries such as Cambodia imposed harsh lockdowns, with rule-breakers
    facing up to twenty years of jail-time. Vietnam was one of the few nations in the world to undergo positive economic change in 2020 because of it's swift response. However, this success has not
    been shared throughout the region. Both the Philippines and Indonesia struggled to contain Covid and faced a sharp recession. With many countries in the region handing out free vaccines to
    their citizens, southeast Asia looks to move on from Covid-19.
