This is a little high school passion project built by Aarush and me. The context of this project is that it was created during the height of the pandemic, where there was no end in sight, most of the world had entered a lockdown phase, and our own schools had shifted to remote learning. We felt there was a lack of centralization with Covid-19 data, with most countries posting their case data in their respective government websites. Additionally, websites that seeked to centralize this information such as the New York Times and United Nations often lacked data from the global south, instead featuring developed countries such as America, the United Kingdom, China, and others.
This was a fun litle project we created to address that issue featuring a bearbones front end created with HTML, utilizing python libraries such as numpy, beautiful soup, and others to help scrape and store the data. Finally, utilizing flask to create the app and integrate everything together.
