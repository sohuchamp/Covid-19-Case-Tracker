<p class = "response" style="font-size: 25px"> With 28 countries being members of the EU, the covid response varied greatly amongst individual nations. Countries such as Italy and France were one of
    the first hotspots of covid-19, they were forced to enact strict lockdowns to curb the spread. They proved to be effective in curbing the spread but debilitating to the economy. Sweden
    attempted the opposite approach, going for herd immunity instead. This strategy proved to be disastrous, and the country eventually had to put in place lockdown-like measures to curb the spread.
    However, slow vaccine role out in many member states and the emergence of a new variant has lead to a resurgence of cases in many member-states.
